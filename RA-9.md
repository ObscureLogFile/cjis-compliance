## Policy & Purpose

This control document defines how `[[AGENCY_NAME]]` implements **RA-9 — Criticality Analysis** for systems, personnel, services, and data within the CJIS scope.

This control addresses ra-9 for CJIS systems, users, or data.

**Implementation objective:** Reassess risks regularly and close findings based on priority.

## Operational roles and responsibilities

- **Control owner (`[[CONTROL_OWNER]]`):** Maintains the procedure, assigns work, reviews evidence, and accepts or escalates exceptions.
- **CJIS Security Officer (`[[CJIS_SECURITY_OFFICER_TITLE]] [[CJIS_SECURITY_OFFICER_NAME]]`):** Interprets CJIS requirements, coordinates assessments, and verifies that evidence supports compliance.
- **System owner / administrator (`[[SYSTEM_OWNER_NAME]]`):** Implements the technical or operational safeguards, records changes, and reports failures.
- **Business and process owners:** Confirm mission need, approve access or process decisions, and validate that the control remains fit for purpose.
- **Internal audit or independent assessor:** Samples operation, tests evidence, documents findings, and tracks remediation.
- **All users and contractors:** Follow the approved procedure and immediately report suspected violations or control failures.

## Step-by-step procedures workflow

**Trigger / inputs**

A new system, user, vendor, change, incident, assessment finding, or scheduled review places **RA-9** in scope. Use the approved requirement, current system record, risk decision, and prior evidence as inputs.

**Procedure**

1. Identify the assets, threats, and vulnerabilities that affect the control area.
2. Rate the risk and assign treatment or mitigation actions.
3. Track remediation and residual risk to closure or acceptance.
4. Reassess on the recurring schedule or after a significant change.
5. Record the result, evidence location, reviewer, date, and any exception or remediation reference.
6. Escalate failures to `[[CONTROL_OWNER]]` and the CJIS Security Officer; do not close the workflow until the issue is remediated, accepted, or linked to an approved POA&M.

**Workflow output**

An approved implementation record, current evidence package, review sign-off, and an exception or remediation record when applicable.

## Organizational action items

- [ ] Assign `[[CONTROL_OWNER]]` and a backup owner for RA-9.
- [ ] Confirm the systems, facilities, personnel, vendors, and data flows covered by RA-9.
- [ ] Approve the agency-specific standard, procedure, configuration baseline, or form needed to operate the control.
- [ ] Record the current implementation state, gap, risk level, and target completion date.
- [ ] Test the control and attach the result to the evidence repository.
- [ ] Schedule the recurring review and assign an accountable reviewer.
- [ ] Track exceptions and corrective actions to closure or documented risk acceptance.

## Audit evidence and continuous compliance artifacts

**Expected evidence:** Risk register, scan results, mitigation plan, signoff.

Maintain, as applicable:

- Current policy, procedure, standard, or system security plan section.
- Owner approval, implementation ticket, configuration export, or signed operational record.
- Test, inspection, review, training, log, or monitoring evidence showing the control operated.
- Recurring review sign-off with sample period, reviewer, date, result, and follow-up.
- Exception, compensating-control, POA&M, incident, or risk-acceptance record.
- Evidence retention location: `[[EVIDENCE_REPOSITORY_URL]]`; retain according to agency records requirements.

**Continuous compliance measures**

- Control status: Implemented / Partially implemented / Planned / Not applicable.
- Evidence freshness: last collected date, next due date, and overdue indicator.
- Exceptions: open count, aging, owner, target date, and residual risk.
- Review result: pass, pass with findings, or fail, with a linked corrective action.

- **Source title:** CRITICALITY ANALYSIS
- **Source marking:** `[Priority 2]`

**Control**

> Identify critical system components and functions by performing a criticality analysis for information system components containing or processing CJI at the planning, design, development, testing, implementation, and maintenance stages of the system development life cycle.

**Discussion**

> Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require significant protections. For example, criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components and functions considers applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, directives, policies, standards, system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a functional decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within and external to the system. The operational environment of a system or a system component may impact the criticality, including the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of- systems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities that such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact of a component or function failure on the organizational missions that are supported by the system that contains the components and functions. Criticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If such analysis is performed early in the system development life cycle, organizations may be able to modify the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and functions, such as by adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system design. Criticality analysis can also influence the protection measures required by development contractors. In addition to criticality analysis for systems, system components, and system services, criticality analysis of information is an important consideration. Such analysis is conducted as part of security categorization in RA-2.
