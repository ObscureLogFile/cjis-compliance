## Policy & Purpose

This control document defines how `[[AGENCY_NAME]]` implements **MP-1 — Policy and Procedures** for systems, personnel, services, and data within the CJIS scope.

This control addresses policy and procedures for CJIS systems, users, or data.

**Implementation objective:** Track media from creation through disposal.

## Operational roles and responsibilities

- **Control owner (`[[CONTROL_OWNER]]`):** Maintains the procedure, assigns work, reviews evidence, and accepts or escalates exceptions.
- **CJIS Security Officer (`[[CJIS_SECURITY_OFFICER_TITLE]] [[CJIS_SECURITY_OFFICER_NAME]]`):** Interprets CJIS requirements, coordinates assessments, and verifies that evidence supports compliance.
- **System owner / administrator (`[[SYSTEM_OWNER_NAME]]`):** Implements the technical or operational safeguards, records changes, and reports failures.
- **Business and process owners:** Confirm mission need, approve access or process decisions, and validate that the control remains fit for purpose.
- **Internal audit or independent assessor:** Samples operation, tests evidence, documents findings, and tracks remediation.
- **All users and contractors:** Follow the approved procedure and immediately report suspected violations or control failures.

## Step-by-step procedures workflow

**Trigger / inputs**

A new system, user, vendor, change, incident, assessment finding, or scheduled review places **MP-1** in scope. Use the approved requirement, current system record, risk decision, and prior evidence as inputs.

**Procedure**

1. Classify and label media based on the CJIS content it contains.
2. Store and transport the media using approved chain-of-custody controls.
3. Track use, movement, and storage in a log or inventory.
4. Sanitize or destroy media when it is no longer needed and retain proof.
5. Record the result, evidence location, reviewer, date, and any exception or remediation reference.
6. Escalate failures to `[[CONTROL_OWNER]]` and the CJIS Security Officer; do not close the workflow until the issue is remediated, accepted, or linked to an approved POA&M.

**Workflow output**

An approved implementation record, current evidence package, review sign-off, and an exception or remediation record when applicable.

## Organizational action items

- [ ] Assign `[[CONTROL_OWNER]]` and a backup owner for MP-1.
- [ ] Confirm the systems, facilities, personnel, vendors, and data flows covered by MP-1.
- [ ] Approve the agency-specific standard, procedure, configuration baseline, or form needed to operate the control.
- [ ] Record the current implementation state, gap, risk level, and target completion date.
- [ ] Test the control and attach the result to the evidence repository.
- [ ] Schedule the recurring review and assign an accountable reviewer.
- [ ] Track exceptions and corrective actions to closure or documented risk acceptance.

## Audit evidence and continuous compliance artifacts

**Expected evidence:** Media inventory, checkout log, destruction certificate.

Maintain, as applicable:

- Current policy, procedure, standard, or system security plan section.
- Owner approval, implementation ticket, configuration export, or signed operational record.
- Test, inspection, review, training, log, or monitoring evidence showing the control operated.
- Recurring review sign-off with sample period, reviewer, date, result, and follow-up.
- Exception, compensating-control, POA&M, incident, or risk-acceptance record.
- Evidence retention location: `[[EVIDENCE_REPOSITORY_URL]]`; retain according to agency records requirements.

**Continuous compliance measures**

- Control status: Implemented / Partially implemented / Planned / Not applicable.
- Evidence freshness: last collected date, next due date, and overdue indicator.
- Exceptions: open count, aging, owner, target date, and residual risk.
- Review result: pass, pass with findings, or fail, with a linked corrective action.

**Control**

> a. Develop, document, and disseminate to authorized individuals: 1. Agency-level media protection policy that: (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among agency entities, and compliance; and (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and 2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the media protection policy and the associated media protection controls; b. Designate an individual with security responsibilities to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the media protection policy and procedures; and c. Review and update the current media protection: 1. Policy at least annually and following any security incidents involving digital and/or non-digital media; and 2. Procedures at least annually and following any security incidents involving digital and/or non-digital media.

**Discussion**

> Media protection policy and procedures address the controls in the MP family that are implemented within systems and agencies. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of media protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the agency level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of agencies. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to media protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an agency policy or procedure.
