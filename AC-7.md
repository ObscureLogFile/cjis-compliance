## Policy & Purpose

This control document defines how `[[AGENCY_NAME]]` implements **AC-7 — Unsuccessful Logon Attempts** for systems, personnel, services, and data within the CJIS scope.

This control addresses unsuccessful logon attempts for CJIS systems, users, or data.

**Implementation objective:** Use centralized identity and access management, unique user accounts, and periodic reviews.

## Operational roles and responsibilities

- **Control owner (`[[CONTROL_OWNER]]`):** Maintains the procedure, assigns work, reviews evidence, and accepts or escalates exceptions.
- **CJIS Security Officer (`[[CJIS_SECURITY_OFFICER_TITLE]] [[CJIS_SECURITY_OFFICER_NAME]]`):** Interprets CJIS requirements, coordinates assessments, and verifies that evidence supports compliance.
- **System owner / administrator (`[[SYSTEM_OWNER_NAME]]`):** Implements the technical or operational safeguards, records changes, and reports failures.
- **Business and process owners:** Confirm mission need, approve access or process decisions, and validate that the control remains fit for purpose.
- **Internal audit or independent assessor:** Samples operation, tests evidence, documents findings, and tracks remediation.
- **All users and contractors:** Follow the approved procedure and immediately report suspected violations or control failures.

## Step-by-step procedures workflow

**Trigger / inputs**

A new system, user, vendor, change, incident, assessment finding, or scheduled review places **AC-7** in scope. Use the approved requirement, current system record, risk decision, and prior evidence as inputs.

**Procedure**

1. Identify the person, role, or system that needs access.
2. Obtain documented approval for the least privilege needed.
3. Provision the account, permissions, and MFA or other required controls.
4. Verify access works as intended and remove any extra privileges.
5. Record the result, evidence location, reviewer, date, and any exception or remediation reference.
6. Escalate failures to `[[CONTROL_OWNER]]` and the CJIS Security Officer; do not close the workflow until the issue is remediated, accepted, or linked to an approved POA&M.

**Workflow output**

An approved implementation record, current evidence package, review sign-off, and an exception or remediation record when applicable.

## Organizational action items

- [ ] Assign `[[CONTROL_OWNER]]` and a backup owner for AC-7.
- [ ] Confirm the systems, facilities, personnel, vendors, and data flows covered by AC-7.
- [ ] Approve the agency-specific standard, procedure, configuration baseline, or form needed to operate the control.
- [ ] Record the current implementation state, gap, risk level, and target completion date.
- [ ] Test the control and attach the result to the evidence repository.
- [ ] Schedule the recurring review and assign an accountable reviewer.
- [ ] Track exceptions and corrective actions to closure or documented risk acceptance.

## Audit evidence and continuous compliance artifacts

**Expected evidence:** Access request forms, approvals, MFA status, access review report.

Maintain, as applicable:

- Current policy, procedure, standard, or system security plan section.
- Owner approval, implementation ticket, configuration export, or signed operational record.
- Test, inspection, review, training, log, or monitoring evidence showing the control operated.
- Recurring review sign-off with sample period, reviewer, date, result, and follow-up.
- Exception, compensating-control, POA&M, incident, or risk-acceptance record.
- Evidence retention location: `[[EVIDENCE_REPOSITORY_URL]]`; retain according to agency records requirements.

**Continuous compliance measures**

- Control status: Implemented / Partially implemented / Planned / Not applicable.
- Evidence freshness: last collected date, next due date, and overdue indicator.
- Exceptions: open count, aging, owner, target date, and residual risk.
- Review result: pass, pass with findings, or fail, with a linked corrective action.

**Control**

> a. Enforce a limit of five (5) consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a 15-minute time period; and30F30F30F b. Automatically lock the account or node until released by an administrator when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.

**Discussion**

> The need to limit unsuccessful logon attempts and take subsequent action when the maximum number of attempts is exceeded applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined, organization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ different algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating system and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC) address. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in support of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to help prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to respond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is exceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally not permitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission or need.
