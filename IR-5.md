## Policy & Purpose

This control document defines how `[[AGENCY_NAME]]` implements **IR-5 — Incident Monitoring** for systems, personnel, services, and data within the CJIS scope.

This control addresses incident monitoring for CJIS systems, users, or data.

**Implementation objective:** Use a clear reporting path and preserve evidence during every incident.

## Operational roles and responsibilities

- **Control owner (`[[CONTROL_OWNER]]`):** Maintains the procedure, assigns work, reviews evidence, and accepts or escalates exceptions.
- **CJIS Security Officer (`[[CJIS_SECURITY_OFFICER_TITLE]] [[CJIS_SECURITY_OFFICER_NAME]]`):** Interprets CJIS requirements, coordinates assessments, and verifies that evidence supports compliance.
- **System owner / administrator (`[[SYSTEM_OWNER_NAME]]`):** Implements the technical or operational safeguards, records changes, and reports failures.
- **Business and process owners:** Confirm mission need, approve access or process decisions, and validate that the control remains fit for purpose.
- **Internal audit or independent assessor:** Samples operation, tests evidence, documents findings, and tracks remediation.
- **All users and contractors:** Follow the approved procedure and immediately report suspected violations or control failures.

## Step-by-step procedures workflow

**Trigger / inputs**

A new system, user, vendor, change, incident, assessment finding, or scheduled review places **IR-5** in scope. Use the approved requirement, current system record, risk decision, and prior evidence as inputs.

**Procedure**

1. Receive the incident report and open a tracked case immediately.
2. Contain the event, preserve evidence, and notify required parties.
3. Remediate the root cause and restore impacted services safely.
4. Close the incident with lessons learned and any corrective actions.
5. Record the result, evidence location, reviewer, date, and any exception or remediation reference.
6. Escalate failures to `[[CONTROL_OWNER]]` and the CJIS Security Officer; do not close the workflow until the issue is remediated, accepted, or linked to an approved POA&M.

**Workflow output**

An approved implementation record, current evidence package, review sign-off, and an exception or remediation record when applicable.

## Organizational action items

- [ ] Assign `[[CONTROL_OWNER]]` and a backup owner for IR-5.
- [ ] Confirm the systems, facilities, personnel, vendors, and data flows covered by IR-5.
- [ ] Approve the agency-specific standard, procedure, configuration baseline, or form needed to operate the control.
- [ ] Record the current implementation state, gap, risk level, and target completion date.
- [ ] Test the control and attach the result to the evidence repository.
- [ ] Schedule the recurring review and assign an accountable reviewer.
- [ ] Track exceptions and corrective actions to closure or documented risk acceptance.

## Audit evidence and continuous compliance artifacts

**Expected evidence:** Incident tickets, timeline, evidence log, after-action report.

Maintain, as applicable:

- Current policy, procedure, standard, or system security plan section.
- Owner approval, implementation ticket, configuration export, or signed operational record.
- Test, inspection, review, training, log, or monitoring evidence showing the control operated.
- Recurring review sign-off with sample period, reviewer, date, result, and follow-up.
- Exception, compensating-control, POA&M, incident, or risk-acceptance record.
- Evidence retention location: `[[EVIDENCE_REPOSITORY_URL]]`; retain according to agency records requirements.

**Continuous compliance measures**

- Control status: Implemented / Partially implemented / Planned / Not applicable.
- Evidence freshness: last collected date, next due date, and overdue indicator.
- Exceptions: open count, aging, owner, target date, and residual risk.
- Review result: pass, pass with findings, or fail, with a linked corrective action.

**Control**

> Track and document incidents.

**Discussion**

> Documenting incidents includes maintaining records about each incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary for forensics as well as evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from a variety of sources, including network monitoring, incident reports, incident response teams, user complaints, supply chain partners, audit monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user and administrator reports. IR-4 provides information on the types of incidents that are appropriate for monitoring.
